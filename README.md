This folder contains the modified caffe library and network architectures for our paper "Automated Melanoma Recognition in Dermoscopy Images via Very Deep Residual Networks".


Note:
1. We have added a new Imageseg datalayer to read image and segmentation masks from a list file. 

2. The installation and dependencies of this caffe version are the same as the original BVLC/master branch of caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).

3. The pre-trained ResNet-50 model can be downloaded from "https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AAFW2-FVoxeVRck&id=4006CBB8476FF777%2117887&cid=4006CBB8476FF777"
